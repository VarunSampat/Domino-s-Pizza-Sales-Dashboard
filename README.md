# Domino's-Pizza-Sales-Dashboard

This interactive dashboard dives deep into Domino’s order trends and helped me answer some key business questions like:

 📊 What time of day drives the most orders?
 📅 Which months (and weekdays) bring in the most revenue?
 🍕 What sizes and categories are customers really loving?

But I didn’t stop there — I pulled out hidden insights like:

 🔍 Low-value late-night hours (time to optimize staffing!)
 🎯 Single-item orders dominating → major upsell opportunity
 💡 Veggie pizzas could be a secret margin booster 💰

Features I used:

 ✅ Interactive button slicers for Month & Quarter
 ✅ Drill-downs on sales by time, category, and pizza name
 ✅ KPI cards, AOV, and smart visuals with clean UX
